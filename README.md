Calling every word in the english language a bitch

## How this works
This is a simple PHP script that reads the requested index from a file,
uses that index to read the respective line from the source document then posts
the desired output to twitter.

## Required Libraries
This project uses the codebird Twitter 0auth library to allow the script to
make an api call
